# Minimalist Portfolio (Rams-inspired)

Single-page, responsive portfolio-style site built with **HTML + CSS Grid + media queries + one JS file**.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
- Use VS Code “Live Server” (recommended) for easier preview.

## Assignment checklist (covered)

- Header + footer
- Navigation with 4 links (Home, About, Collection, Contact)
- Burger menu on small screens (< 900px)
- Sections: Home / About (with inline images) / Collection (grid) / Contact (form)
- CSS Grid used for layouts + gallery
- Media queries for mobile vs desktop (+ optional tablet tuning)
- Fluid type/spacing via `clamp()`
- JavaScript in a single file (`script.js`), uses `let`

## Images

The page is currently wired to use your real images from `BRAUN/BRAUN/`.

Placeholder SVGs are also included in `assets/` (useful if you move/rename images).

Already wired in `index.html`:

- `assets/tp1-1.svg` (hero)
- `assets/speaker-dots.svg` (about inline)
- `assets/rams-room.svg` (about inline)
- `assets/tp1-2.svg` … `assets/tp1-8.svg` (collection grid)
